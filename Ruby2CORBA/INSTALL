Requirements
============

Windows XP (not tested on Vista), Linux (kernel version 2.4+; tested on
openSuSE 10.2) or Solaris (tested on sparc SunOS 5.10).

Ruby 1.8.5+ (probably also works with previous 1.8 versions but not tested)
  Download from http://www.ruby-lang.org
  (for Solaris get Ruby from Blastwave.org prebuilt with SunCC or build from
   source using either SunCC or GCC).

ACE+TAO x.5.6+ (probably also work with previous x.5 versions but not tested)
  Download latest beta from http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/ (select a
  source only package containing at least ACE + TAO)

For running the regression tests on Windows the Ruby 'windows' gem is required.
Download and install by executing the command 'gem install windows-pr' (version
>= 6.5 is required).

An installed (recent) version of PERL is required to generate the ACE+TAO and
R2CORBA makefiles with the MPC toolset included with ACE+TAO (R2CORBA does not
use MKMF because it was easier to create an extension makefile based on the
ACE+TAO buildsystem than viceversa;-).
For Windows we advice ActiveState Perl from www.activestate.com.
For Solaris get Perl from Blastwave.org.

On Windows: MS Visual C++ 7.1
  (MSVC 6 works for Ruby but is not supported anymore for recent ACE+TAO versions)
  (MSVC 8 is supported for ACE+TAO but requires a Ruby installation also built
   with MSVC 8 where the standard Windows binary distribution is built with MSVC 6
   and cannot work with MSVC 8 built extension libraries; you would have to build
   your own Ruby installation, including standard extensions, with MSVC 8 from
   the sourcetree)
On Linux: GCC >= 3.2 (tested with GCC 4.1.2)
On Solaris: GCC >= 3.4 (tested with GCC 4.0.2 from Blastwave.org) or SunCC >= 5

Building R2CORBA Ruby extension
===============================

Preparation
-----------

- verify installation of Ruby (with required gem if necessary), PERL and C++
  compiler
- make sure the compiler and the make utility can be executed from the commandline
  (on Windows you might have to run the vsvars32.bat included with MSVC depending
   on your MSVC installation)

Simple configuration
--------------------

- download an ACE+TAO source package
- create an ACE subdirectory under the Ruby2CORBA directory created by unpacking
  the Ruby2CORBA distribution package
- unpack the ACE+TAO package under the ACE subdirectory creating an ACE_wrappers
  directory and sourcetree
- configure the build by executing the command:

  ruby setup.rb config

- build the extension by executing the command:

  ruby setup.rb setup

- verify the extension by executing the command:

  ruby setup.rb test

- install the extension by executing the command:

  ruby setup.rb install

By default the setup script will install R2CORBA in the site specific section of
the Ruby installation.
On Windows the required ACE+TAO dlls will be installed in the Ruby bin directory
(which should be included in the PATH).
On Linux default installation will require root access as the ACE+TAO SOs will
be installed under /usr/lib.

Customized configuration
-----------------------

The optional config parameter '--aceroot=<path>' can be used to specify a different
location of the ACE_wrappers sourcetree than under the default ./Ruby2CORBA/ACE
directory. Parameter '--taoroot=<path>' can be used to specify a non-standard location
of the TAO subtree (defaults to $aceroot/TAO).

Alternatively the environment variable ACE_ROOT can be set to the ACE_wrappers
path. If the setup script cannot find ACE+TAO at ./RubyCORBA/ACE and no '--aceroot'
parameter is specified it will use the value of this environment variable if set.
The same applies for the environment variable TAO_ROOT and the '--taoroot' parameter.

The optional config parameter '--aceinstdir=<path>' can be set to specify a
different install location for the ACE+TAO shared libraries (esspecially useful on
Linux if you cannot/don't want to have root access.
Please be aware that for the R2CORBA extension to work the ACE+TAO shared libraries
need to be in the OS specific search path for the dynamic library loader.

NOTE: The '--prefix' option of the 'install' command does *not* work correctly.
      Instead use the various path options of the 'config' command to configure
      non-default install targets.

The optional config parameter '--without-tao' will exclude the build steps for the
ACE+TAO libraries from the extension build process.
This can be used on a system which already has a compatible ACE+TAO version installed.

NOTE: This option has not been tested.
NOTE: Please be aware the setup script still needs an accessible ACE_wrappers
      sourcetree to build the extension.

Running the command 'ruby setup.rb --help' will show information on all setup
script options including the 'common' options.
The setup script 'setup.rb' is a slightly modified version of Minero Aoki's
original version.
