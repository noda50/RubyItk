R2CORBA LICENSE

R2CORBA (Licensed Product) is protected by copyright, and is distributed
under the following terms.

R2CORBA (Ruby to CORBA) is an open source tool, developed by Remedy IT and
written in Ruby and C++. It is designed to provide a CORBA mapping for
the Ruby programming language.
Instead of going for a complete native Ruby mapping implementing a native
Ruby ORB R2CORBA aims at providing CORBA functionality through a Ruby
extension written in Ruby & C++ using the DII and DSI interfaces of an
existing C++ implementation of CORBA; TAO (The ACE ORB). This extension is
appropriately called R2TAO.
A native Ruby implementation of an OMG IDL compiler supplements this
extension and provides powerfull features like direct inclusion of IDL
language modules into your Ruby programs without the need of precompiling.

Since R2CORBA is open source and free of licensing fees, you are free to use,
modify, and distribute the source code, as long as you include this
copyright statement.

In particular, you can use R2CORBA to build proprietary software and are
under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code that is built
using R2CORBA. Note, however, that you may not do anything to the R2CORBA
code, such as copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the R2CORBA
code, that will prevent R2CORBA from being distributed freely using an open
source development model.
