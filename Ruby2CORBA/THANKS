Our thanks go to:

* Yukihiro Matsumoto, a.k.a. “Matz”, for creating the wonderfully
  powerful and elegant programming language named Ruby.
  With him we also thank all those who have contributed to the
  Ruby programming tool and have made Ruby what it is today.

* Prof. Douglas Schmidt for (and all his collaborators) for creating
  a high-quality OpenSource CORBA compliant ORB. The high level of
  OS abstraction and multiplatform compatibility of this software
  make it an ideal ingredient for a Ruby CORBA implementation.

* Minero Aoki for creating the original 'setup.rb' install script.

* Daisuke Kanda for his initial work on CORBA bindings for Ruby from
  2001 (incl. RINN and Ruby-Orbit) which has helped us in many ways
  to create R2CORBA.

* Paul Brannan of Automated Trading Desk, LLC for his insightfull
  comments on the first release of the Ruby CORBA language mapping.

* Renato Lucindo and Eider Oliveira for their remarks and fixes for
  the IDL compiler.

* Ragnar Dahlen for his tests and comments.
