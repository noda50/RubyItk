* What is Ruby2CORBA

Ruby2CORBA (R2CORBA) is a CORBA mapping implementation for the Ruby
programming language (see http://www.ruby-lang.org).
Instead of going for a complete native Ruby mapping implementing a native
Ruby ORB, R2CORBA aims at providing CORBA functionality through a Ruby
extension written in Ruby & C++ using the DII and DSI interfaces of an
existing C++ implementation of CORBA; TAO (The ACE ORB; see
http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html).
A native Ruby implementation of an OMG IDL compiler supplements this
extension and provides powerful features like direct inclusion of IDL
language modules into your Ruby programs without the need of precompiling.
